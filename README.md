🧠 Project Overview

Project Title: Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. By leveraging data analytics and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project helps identify how people feel about entities such as companies, products, or events across various social platforms.

🎯 Objectives

Extract and preprocess real-world social media data for sentiment analysis.

Classify posts or tweets into sentiment categories such as Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Irrelevant.

Analyze brand-specific sentiment trends to understand audience perception.

Visualize insights through intuitive charts and graphs for better interpretation.

📊 Key Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw text (removing noise, punctuation, and stopwords).

Sentiment categorization using labeled datasets (e.g., Twitter training data).

Brand-level sentiment comparison and trend visualization.

Insights into how public sentiment varies across entities or time.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

NLTK / TextBlob / Scikit-learn – Sentiment analysis and NLP tasks

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

📁 Dataset

The dataset used (e.g., twitter_training.csv) contains social media posts with associated entities, sentiment labels, and content. Each record includes:

ID – Unique identifier

Entity – Brand or topic name

Sentiment – Sentiment label (Positive, Negative, Neutral, etc.)

Content – The actual tweet or post text

📈 Sample Insights

Identify which brands have the highest positive or negative mentions.

Track shifts in sentiment over time or across campaigns.

Compare audience perception between competing entities.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Integrate live social media APIs (e.g., Twitter API or X API).

Apply deep learning models (e.g., BERT or LSTM) for improved sentiment accuracy.

Build an interactive dashboard for real-time visualization.
